## About Telethon Documentation

As you can read at Telethon Docs (https://docs.telethon.dev/en/)
> This library is meant to make it easy for you to write Python programs that can interact with Telegram. Think of it as a wrapper that has already done the heavy job for you, so you can focus on developing an application.

For usage, methods, references and more please [read the docs](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/).
