### Transcrição

> :woman: **Sam**: Hello, this is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English.
I'm Sam.

> :man: **Neil**: And I'm Neil. 
How are you today, Sam?

> :woman: **Sam**: Thanks for asking, Neil. 
I'm fine not. 

> :man: **Neil**: Sorry, so are you fine or not?

> :woman: **Sam**: Oh, did I confusy? My bad!

> :man: **Neil**: ahh, Sam is speaking English. 
Just a very modern type of English. 
For example saying "my bad" instead of "my fault".
[... accepting] she is wrong.

> :woman: **Sam**: or adding __not__ at the end of a sentence to show that 
I really mean the opposite of [... said].
Both examples are small changes in English with happens naturally over the last [decade or two]

> :man: **Neil**: changes like this happens because unlike [said] latin with no one speaks [this] today
English is a living language.
 A language who people speak, use and [... lives]

> :woman: **Sam**: new [...] in English are invented as people use the language in new ways.
But what happens when a language comes from an entirely diffent galaxy?
Someone like [Kronos ... of the planets of the Klingons]

> :man: **Neil**: Yes! When sci-fi tv show star-trek introduce aliens caracters [... Klingons].
The [...] is need to invent a [whole] new language, [Klingon].

> :woman: **Sam**: entirely madeup and unrelated to any human language.
[Klingon] was developed [a light of his own]. 
Today you can even study it at the university. 
So Neil my crazy question is this:

> :woman: **Sam**: In 2010 [Klingon] became the first invented language to do what? Is it:
(a) Have [own] dictionary; 
(b) Have an opera [...]
(c) Be recognize as an official language by the United Nations

> :man: **Neil**: Hmmm. Every language needs vocabulary so I'll say (a) Klingon was the first inventd language to have his own dictionary

> :woman: **Sam**: Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the answer later on the program. Klingon isn't the only madeup language invented for the movies [... a language used on fantasy TV show Game of Thrones].

> :man: **Neil**: From his home in Los Angeles David spoke to [Mike Rousel present of BBC radio for program ....]. They discuss [...] in the twelve century.

> 👷‍♂️ **David**: What we had is an entirely [list of nouns a whole list of nouns and many of ... ]. And [she dropped in two sounds using later grammar and another later words] Isn't a language proper as we understand it now because [while] we're talking about language ins't just the vocabulary it's the grammar. Neverless we still kind of looking [...].

> :woman: **Sam**: [...] invented new nouns but using [...] grammar so david doesn't think her invention is a properly language.
Neverless things [...] languages

> :man: **Neil**: [The ... to something refers to a Christian say who believe to give special help to a particular specific activity.
Here the activity is inventing a common language, short or constructed language].
Artificially invented languages like Klingon and [...].

> :woman: **Sam**: Another famous constructed language, Esperanto, was invented in 1887 by polish doctor [...].
He want to make it easier for people who spoke different languages to communicate with each other.

> :man: **Neil**: Listen as [David ...] speaking Esperanto with [Michael ...] and testing how much he understand for BBC radio four program with [...].
