# Inventing Languages

> **Sam**: Hello, this is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English.
I'm Sam.

> **Neil**: And I'm Neil. 
How are you today, Sam?

> **Sam**: Thanks for asking, Neil. 
I'm fine not. 

> **Neil**: Sorry, so are you fine or not?

> **Sam**: Oh, did I confusy? My bad!

> **Neil**: ahh, Sam is speaking English. 
Just a very modern type of English. 
For example saying "my bad" instead of "my fault". [... accepting] she is wrong.

> **Sam**: or adding __not__ at the end of a sentence to show that 
I really mean the opposite of [... said].
Both examples are small changes in English with happens naturally over the last [decade or two]

> **Neil**: changes like this happens because unlike [said] latin with no one speaks [this] today
English is a living language.
 A language who people speak, use and [... lives]

> **Sam**: new [...] in English are invented as people use the language in new ways.
But what happens when a language comes from an entirely diffent galaxy?
Someone like [Kronos ... of the planets of the Klingons]

> **Neil**: Yes! When sci-fi tv show star-trek introduce aliens caracters [... Klingons].
The [...] is need to invent a [whole] new language, [Klingon].

> **Sam**: entirely madeup and unrelated to any human language.
[Klingon] was developed [a light of his own]. 
Today you can even study it at the university. 
So Neil my crazy question is this:

> **Sam**: In 2010 [Klingon] became the first invented language to do what? Is it:
(a) Have [own] dictionary; 
(b) Have a opera [...]
(c) Be recognize as an official language by the United Nations
